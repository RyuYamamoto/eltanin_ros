# eltanin_ros

ROS 2 packages that connect [`eltanin`](https://github.com/RyuYamamoto/eltanin) — a ROS-independent
C++20 2D navigation library — to ROS 2, and replace the [`navyu`](https://github.com/RyuYamamoto/navyu)
navigation stack. All planning, control and costmap logic lives in `eltanin`; the packages here own
only the ROS boundary: parameters, topics, TF, clocks and lifecycle.

The design is recorded in [`docs/design/eltaninnavyuros.md`](docs/design/eltaninnavyuros.md).

## Safety notice

> **TODO (task 23).** The real-robot (kachaka) startup sequence and its safety warnings are written
> here once the sequence has been validated on hardware. The key warning to document is that
> **enabling command output while the robot is on its dock causes it to drive forward** — the
> `collision_predictor` output must stay disabled until a human has confirmed the robot is off the
> dock (design §7.1 / F-17 / R-5).
>
> Until then, treat every launch file in this repository as simulation-only.

## Workspace layout

`eltanin_ros` is one repository inside a colcon workspace that also holds `eltanin` itself:

```
~/workspace/eltanin_ws/
└── src/
    ├── eltanin/       ROS-independent navigation library (plain CMake)
    ├── eltanin_ros/   this repository
    └── navyu/         the stack being replaced (reference only)
```

`eltanin_vendor` builds and installs `eltanin` through `ExternalProject`, and its default source
path is `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../eltanin`, which resolves to `src/eltanin` from
`src/eltanin_ros/eltanin_vendor`. CI reproduces the same relative layout by checking this
repository out into `src/eltanin_ros` and running `vcs import src < src/eltanin_ros/.repos`.

`eltanin` itself never gains a `package.xml` or any other ROS file.

## Requirements

| Item | Version / note |
|---|---|
| ROS 2 | Jazzy (`/opt/ros/jazzy`) |
| C++ | C++20 (required by `eltanin`) |
| CMake | 3.20 or later |
| Eigen | 3.4 or later |
| yaml-cpp | any version packaged for Jazzy |
| RMW | `rmw_zenoh_cpp` |

`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp` is used for every node (design §7 / F-12). `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` and
`ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY` are not relied on as isolation mechanisms.

`rmw_zenoh_cpp` is **not** part of `/opt/ros/jazzy` on the development machine; it is built from
source in `~/workspace/ros2_ws`. Source that overlay in addition to the distribution:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/workspace/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp
```

## Build

```bash
cd ~/workspace/eltanin_ws
vcs import src < src/eltanin_ros/.repos
rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jazzy
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args --no-warn-unused-cli \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

`RelWithDebInfo` is the default because `eltanin` uses `assert()` for its preconditions, and an
`abort()` on a real robot means the node dies and `/cmd_vel` stops (design §4.3). To build `eltanin`
with those asserts enabled during development, add:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args --no-warn-unused-cli \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DELTANIN_VENDOR_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

`ELTANIN_VENDOR_BUILD_TYPE` controls only the `eltanin` ExternalProject, so the two build types can
be chosen independently. CI runs both `Debug` and `RelWithDebInfo` (R-18).

## Packages

Ten packages are planned (design §4). Only the metapackage exists today; everything else is listed
with the task that creates it, so that nothing looks available before it is.

| Package | Contents | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `eltanin_ros` | metapackage (`ament_package` only) | **implemented** |
| `eltanin_vendor` | builds and installs `eltanin` via `ExternalProject` | not implemented (task 3) |
| `eltanin_msgs` | msg / srv / action definitions, interfaces only | not implemented (task 3) |
| `eltanin_ros_common` | conversions, clock, watchdog, TF, parameter validation | not implemented (tasks 4, 5) |
| `eltanin_costmap` | `global_costmap` and `local_map` nodes | not implemented (tasks 6, 15) |
| `eltanin_planner` | `global_path_planner` and `local_path_planner` nodes | not implemented (tasks 7, 17, 19) |
| `eltanin_controller` | `path_follower` and `collision_predictor` nodes | not implemented (tasks 11, 12) |
| `eltanin_navigator` | orchestrator | not implemented (tasks 13, 21) |
| `eltanin_simulator` | `simple_simulator` node | not implemented (task 10) |
| `eltanin_bringup` | launch / config / rviz / map, no code | not implemented (tasks 8, 22) |

The metapackage's `package.xml` deliberately declares no dependencies; each package is added to it
as that package lands.

## Launch

No launch files exist yet. Simulation bringup is added in task 8 and kachaka bringup in task 22.

## Development

### pre-commit

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Run `clang-format` **through pre-commit**, not through the system binary. The hook pins
clang-format 17.0.6 while Ubuntu 24.04 ships 18.1.3, and the pinned version is authoritative:

```bash
pre-commit run clang-format --all-files
```

### Style and lint

- `.clang-format` is byte-identical to `../navyu/.clang-format` (ament_clang_format based, Google
  style, `ColumnLimit: 100`, `PointerAlignment: Middle`, `BreakBeforeBraces: Custom`).
- `CPPLINT.cfg` sits at the repository root and applies to every package. It disables the six
  checks `ament_cpplint` disables unconditionally, plus `build/header_guard` and
  `build/include_order`. Those last two cannot be reconciled with the ROS 2 conventions:
  upstream cpplint cannot produce ROS 2 double-underscore guard names (that is an `ament_cpplint`
  extension), and its include order is the reverse of the `IncludeCategories` in `.clang-format`.
- Because cpplint no longer checks it, the **header guard convention is enforced by review**:
  `#ifndef PACKAGE__PATH_TO_FILE_HPP_`, e.g. `ELTANIN_ROS_COMMON__CONVERSIONS_HPP_`.
- `legal/copyright` stays enabled. Every source file starts with `// Copyright <year> RyuYamamoto.`
  followed by the Apache-2.0 header, matching `eltanin` and `navyu`.

### Compiler warnings

Each package adds `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` with
`target_compile_options(<target> PRIVATE ...)` and promotes them to errors when
`ELTANIN_ROS_ENABLE_WERROR` is `ON`. CI passes `-DELTANIN_ROS_ENABLE_WERROR=ON`. These flags are
never set through `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`, because that would leak them into the `eltanin_vendor`
ExternalProject and into `rosidl` generated code.

### API rules

`eltanin`'s preconditions are `assert()`-based and disappear under `RelWithDebInfo`, so an
out-of-range cell access becomes undefined behaviour rather than an abort (R-18). Therefore
**do not write raw `GridMap::operator()` in `eltanin_ros`.** Use the bounds-checked API only:
`get` / `set` / `world_to_map` / `world_rect_to_cells`. Validate `resolution() > 0`,
`cell_count() > 0`, `create()` returning `nullopt`, and `dt > 0` at the ROS boundary and reject bad
input with a single error line naming the offending parameter (design §4.3).

### Branches

Work happens on `dev`. `main` is updated only through a pull request from `dev` (D-28); never push
to `main` directly.

## License

Apache-2.0, matching `eltanin` and `navyu`. A `LICENSE` file is not yet committed to this
repository; source files carry the Apache-2.0 header.
